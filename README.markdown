What is it?
-----------

It's a rewrite of the original jQuery [LavaLamp plugin](http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/?p=7), which itself was a jQuery implementation of Guillermo Rauch's MooTools-based [Fancy Menu](http://devthought.com/cssjavascript-true-power-fancy-menu/).

Why rewrite it?
---------------

We needed to be able to control the menu programmatically and this was impossible with the original jQuery version. This new version adds an object interface whilst preserving backwards-compatibility.
